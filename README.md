# ScrumProject

The code of the project is divided into 4 parts. 

**GedcomProcess** is the key method used to extract information from the original Gedcom file, including creating the Person class, generating information tables, and so on. 

**GedcomClass** is the place where the class is defined, including the methods owned by the class. 

**GedcomTest** is used to test the methods of the class. Of course, you can also test other content. 

**GedcomMain** is the main method used to call GedcomProcess and GedcomClass.

**PreprocessedOutput.txt** is the text file generated by adding "<---" to each record and separating it with "|" in the first project homework.

**ValidRecords.txt** is the file generated by extracting the valid data in PreprocessedOutput and separating each individual and family.

**2Tables.txt** extracts the individual and family information in ValidRecords, and converts them into the list, and outputs the two tables through PrettyTable.
